In a cage the quiet ruby-red bunker
Unseen boy who have control of the room

Power will need the boy
Why does power always seek the boy?
Why does power make the crazy boy more more?
"Where's the boy?" Power called.
"I am here"

I will sell my soul to the devil
If I can be the top of the world

I will sell my soul to the devil
If I can be the top of the world

I will sell my soul to the devil
If I can be the top of the world
Be the top of the world

He was funny and fine sweet sweet good boy
Said he liked me like power
Changed the boy not like before

Oh no
I am not a boy I can't hold all the powers
All the power that men will start?
I don't care I have power
Heart and soul I know what I want

Oh no
I am not a boy I can't hold all the powers
All the power

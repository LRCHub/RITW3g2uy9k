Na nana na na nana

Had to ask if she was from around here
Answered no said I'm a mysterious traveller
From the Jet set I asked, no but international
Long distance sleep walker, casual small talker
Final destination? Well I'm not quite sure
Not yet past my prime and you still look so pure
Want to be here and everywhere tell me
Where will I be when I'm there?

She's a Mecho Maniac, puppet on a superstring
Na nana na na nana
Dancing venus fly trap, love stealing queen machine

Two days pass she's nowhere to be found
Young kid rider now you've hit the ground
Comes into my mind that I was left behind by a
Well travelled time tourist, equinox fashionist
Will we meet again cause more than's met the eye has
Slipped right out my door but there must be some more
Want to be here and everywhere tell me
Where will I be when I'm there?
